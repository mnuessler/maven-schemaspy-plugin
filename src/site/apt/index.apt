Maven 2 SchemaSpy Plugin

  The SchemaSpy plugin allows you to automatically run the {{{http://schemaspy.sourceforge.net/}SchemaSpy}} database analysis tool
  on a dabatase and generate a site report with its results.
  SchemaSpy (http://schemaspy.sourceforge.net) does not need to be installed and
  accessible on your machine. However, SchemaSpy also needs the
  {{{http://www.graphviz.org/}Graphviz}} tool to generate graphical representations
  of the table/view relationships, so this needs to be installed on your
  machine.

  The plugin accepts configuration parameters that will be used to customize the execution of the SchemaSpy tool.

* Usage

   Instructions on how to use the SchemaSpy Plugin can be found {{{usage.html}here}}.
